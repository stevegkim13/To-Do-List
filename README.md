This is the first project I have built after 2 months of learning front-end languages on a Udemy course.
I am utilizing HTML, CSS, JS, and JQuery. 
This To-Do list will be able to create new tasks, mark completed tasks, and delete items off the list.
A date and time will also be displayed on the site.
Enjoy! :)
